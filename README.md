# Snake-Game by Alexander Schwartz

Snake: Programmed by Alexander Schwartz


Based on the classic Snake game, this application was designed in python using Pygame and NumPy libraries.

Developed with object-oriented programming (OOP), it relies on both event handling and the use of objects.

I am working towards launching this game as a scalable web app online to support multiplayer competitions.

This is one of my favorite games so it's exciting I have a lot of fun with it!
