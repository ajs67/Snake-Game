# Snake-Game by Alexander Schwartz

Snake: Programmed by Alexander Schwartz
---------------------------------------------------


Based on the classic Snake game, this application was designed in python using Pygame and NumPy libraries.

Developed with object-oriented programming (OOP), it relies on both event handling and the use of objects.

I am working towards launching this game as a scalable web app online to support multiplayer competitions.

This is one of my favorite games, so enjoy!
---------------------------------------------------

Menu Controls:

Choose your difficulty:
1 = Slow   2 = Medium   3 = Fast   0 = Impossible.

Enter = Play/Pause/Resume Game

Escape = Exit Game

A = Change Maps (in menu only)

+/- = change speed incrementally

---------------------------------------------------

In game controls:

M = Mute Music

Directional keys = Control the snake.

---------------------------------------------------

You increase your score by eating more apples, as you eat more apples, the snake becomes longer.

Good Luck, and have fun!
