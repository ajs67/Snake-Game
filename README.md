Snake: Programmed by Alexander Schwartz
---------------------------------------------------
![Snake Gameplay](/resources/gameplayAll.gif "All Maps")

Based on the classic Snake game, this game was designed in python using Pygame and NumPy libraries.

Developed with object-oriented programming (OOP), it relies on both event handling and the use of objects.

Reads and stores maps as bit files and decodes into numpy arrays to populate the walls.

Maps are easily created and edited just by typing in visually descriptive files.
Walls = 1 and Empty space = 0

High score gets saved locally into the resources folder. If you want to reset, you can delete the file (Or cheat and rewrite the score)

I am working towards launching this game as a scalable web app online to support multiplayer competitions.

This is one of my favorite games! Enjoy!
